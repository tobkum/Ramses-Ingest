# Default naming rules for footage matching.
#
# Each rule has a regex 'pattern' with named groups 'sequence' and/or 'shot'.
# Optional prefixes are prepended to the captured value.
# Set 'use_parent_dir_as_sequence: true' to derive the sequence from the folder name.
#
# Rules are tried in order — the first match wins.

rules:
  # SEQ010_SH020  or  SEQ010-SH020_PLATE_v01
  - pattern: "(?P<sequence>[A-Za-z]*\\d+)[_-](?P<shot>[A-Za-z]*\\d+)"
    sequence_prefix: ""
    shot_prefix: ""

  # Folder = sequence, filename = shot (e.g.  SEQ010/SH020.0001.exr)
  - pattern: "(?P<shot>[A-Za-z]*\\d+)"
